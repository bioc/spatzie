This vignette describes how to use spatzie to identify pairs of transcription factors whose sequence motifs (that describe their binding sites) are co-enriched in enhancers and promoters that interact with each other. ChIA-PET [@pmid19247990], HiChIP [@pmid27643841] or Hi-C [@pmid19815776] are molecular biology assays commonly used to investigate long-range genomic interactions and the data they generate, once properly processed (BEDPE format), serves as input to spatzie co-enrichment analyses.


# Load data

Here we use interactions data in BEDPE format based on a ChIA-PET assay. *Interactions data* in BEDPE format is a tab-separated file, where each line describes one interaction between two *anchors*, i.e., two regions of the genome that are potentially far away from each other.

`yy1_interactions_file` is a toy BEDPE example data from a ChIA-PET experiment in murine embryonic stem cells, targeting the transcription factor YY1.

`motifs_file` is a toy motif database. The HOCOMOCO motif database [@Kulakovskiy2018] is commonly used, but any motif file compatible with `TFBSTools::readJASPARMatrix()` can be used.

```{r sc_load_interactions}
yy1_interactions_file <- system.file("extdata/yy1_interactions.bedpe.gz",
                                     package = "spatzie")
int_data_df <- read.table(gzfile(yy1_interactions_file), header = TRUE,
                          sep = "\t")

motifs_file <- system.file("extdata/motifs_subset.txt.gz",
                           package = "spatzie")
```

# Run spatzie enhancer-promoter motif co-enrichment analysis

`spatzie::find_ep_coenrichment()` identifies co-enriched pairs of motifs in enhancer-promoter interactions by first annotating interaction anchors in `int_data_df` and discarding interactions that are not between promoters and enhancers. Second, anchor regions are scanned for motif hits using `spatzie::scan_motifs()`. Third, motifs present in less than a certain fraction of interactions are discarded (`spatzie::filter_motifs()`). And fourth, `spatzie::anchor_pair_enrich()` identifies co-enriched motif pairs, i.e., motif A is consistently present in promoters that interact with enhancers containing motif B.

```{r sc_load_promoters, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
res <- spatzie::find_ep_coenrichment(int_data_df, motifs_file,
                                     motifs_file_matrix_format = "pfm",
                                     genome_id = "mm9",
                                     cooccurrence_method = "count")
```

# Results

## Interaction type pie chart

The plot shows the types of interactions before filtering.

```{r sc_annotate_interactions, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
plot(res$annotation_pie_chart)
```

## Motif co-enrichment matrix

The heatmap shows co-enrichment for all motif pairs.

```{r sc_compute_cosignificance_count, fig.keep="none"}
pheatmap::pheatmap(-log2(res$motif_cooccurrence$pair_motif_enrich),
                   fontsize = 6)
```

```{r sc_compute_cosignificance_count_save, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%", fig.cap=NULL, fig.align="center"}
pheatmap::pheatmap(-log2(res$motif_cooccurrence$pair_motif_enrich),
                   fontsize = 6,
                   filename = "./figure/sc_compute_cosignificance_count-1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figure/sc_compute_cosignificance_count-1.png")
```

YY1 binds enhancer and promoter sites providing scaffolding that forms enhancer-promoter interactions in mouse stem cells [@Weintraub2017]. As expected, spatzie identified a statistically significant co-occurrence of YY1 motifs indicating this dependency.

When interpreting spatzie results, keep in mind that motif databases such as HOCOMOCO often include groups of transcription factors with highly similar DNA-binding motifs (in this example YY1 and ZF.5), and the putative co-enrichment of one pair of transcription factor binding sites might be explained by another pair with highly similar motifs.

Please note that the motifs and the interactions data used in this vignette are dummy data used for demonstration purposes only.
