This vignette describes how to use spatzie to identify pairs of transcription factors whose sequence motifs (that describe their binding sites) are co-enriched in enhancers and promoters that interact with each other. ChIA-PET, HiChIP or HiC are molecular biology assays commonly used to investigate long-range genomic interactions and the data they generate, once properly processed (BEDPE format), serves as input to spatzie co-enrichment analyses.


# Load data

Here we use interactions data in BEDPE format based on a ChIA-PET assay. *Interactions data* in BEDPE format is a tab-separated file, where each line describes one interaction between two *anchors*, i.e., two regions of the genome that are potentially far away from each other.

`yy1_interactions_file` is a toy BEDPE example data from a ChIA-PET experiment in murine embryonic stem cells, targeting the transcription factor YY1.

`motifs_file` is a toy motif database. The HOCOMOCO motif database is commonly used, but any motif file compatible with `TFBSTools::readJASPARMatrix()` can be used.


```r
yy1_interactions_file <- system.file("extdata/yy1_interactions.bedpe.gz",
                                     package = "spatzie")
int_data_df <- read.table(gzfile(yy1_interactions_file), header = TRUE,
                          sep = "\t")

motifs_file <- system.file("extdata/motifs_subset.txt.gz",
                           package = "spatzie")
```

# Run spatzie enhancer-promoter motif co-enrichment analysis

`spatzie::find_ep_coenrichment()` identifies co-enriched pairs of motifs in enhancer-promoter interactions by first annotating interaction anchors in `int_data_df` and discarding interactions that are not between promoters and enhancers. Second, anchor regions are scanned for motif hits using `spatzie::scan_motifs()`. Third, motifs present in less than a certain fraction of interactions are discarded (`spatzie::filter_motifs()`). And fourth, `spatzie::anchor_pair_enrich()` identifies co-enriched motif pairs, i.e., motif A is consistently present in promoters that interact with enhancers containing motif B.


```r
res <- spatzie::find_ep_coenrichment(int_data_df, motifs_file,
                                     motifs_file_matrix_format = "pfm",
                                     genome_id = "mm9",
                                     cooccurrence_method = "count")
```
