Description: Identifies motifs that are significantly co-enriched from
    enhancer-promoter interaction data. While enhancer-promoter annotation
    is commonly used to define groups of interaction anchors, spatzie also
    supports co-enrichment analysis between preprocessed interaction
    anchors.  Supports BEDPE interaction data derived from genome-wide
    assays such as HiC, ChIA-PET, and HiChIP. Can also be used to look for
    differentially enriched motif pairs between two interaction
    experiments.
